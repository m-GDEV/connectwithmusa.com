### Here are some of technologies used in this project:
- 🔨 React to build the site
- 💅 TailwindCSS for styling
- 🚝 React router for page routing
- 🚀 Vite for the developement server and tooling
- 😀 Hero Icons for icons
- ✏️ Contentful for content management
- 💬 Cusdis for commenting system

I created this site to really grasp React and the libraries the go with it, this being my second React site. I also had the goal of understanding how the whole new era in web development functions as a whole ecosystem, by that I mean node.js, npm, and managing dependencies, etc. In building this project I learned exactly that. I used TailwindCSS in this project wanting to try something new but being utterly disgusted all the while. The thought of having numerous utlities as class names with extremely long lines made me weary. But now, I completely understand. The ease of this tool is astounding. I aslo used React-Router for routing as well as Vite for tooling. Creating this site has proved ever beneficial and I'm glad I decieded to pursue it. This was a great project and I look forward to continually modifying / completely rebuilding it in the future.

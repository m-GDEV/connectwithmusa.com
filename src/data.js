    description: `ifetch is a simple Linux "fetch" program. 
                    Run in a terminal, it fetches the most important 
                    information about your system including the OS, 
                    Kernel, Shell, and more.`,
    longDescription: `
## What is this?
ifetch is meant to be an extremely lightweight alternative to other fetch programs such as
**neofetch, pfetch, ufetch**, etc. It fetches the most important information about your system
including the **OS, Kernel, Shell**, and more. ifetch ***DOES NOT*** waste time printing custom
ASCII art for your distro. Instead, ifetch prints a small cute ASCII Tux.


## Another fetch program?
Yes. I made this as a fun personal project and because I wanted to make a more lightweight version of other system fetchers; specifically neofetch.
This project was made in the spirit of being lightweight and small. In the spirit of being lightweight, ***ifetch is less than 100 lines of code!***
While writing this program I avoided using any third-party programs to gather the information; further adding to its simplicity and it being lightweight.

export const aboutInfo = `ðŸ‘‹ Hi there! My name is Musa Ahmed. 
  I started learning to code during the initial Covid lockdowns and have been hooked ever since.
  I created this site to be a personal portfolio, a place for my blog, and a fun project to learn React.js and TailwindCSS.
  I am interested in all things computer, including the science behind it and the GNU/Linux OS in particular. I also very much enjoy learning new things 
  in the software development sphere and beyond as well. Typically, in my free time I enjoy coding up new projects that solve an issue for me, just for fun, or 
  to learn a new technology. I also like to play video games and chess when I get a chance. Above you can find all my important online accounts.
  If you would like to reach out to me, simply click the Contact page on the header and send me a message! Thanks for reading, have a great day :)`;
